"""Ask Gemini which layout a video needs, once per video.

The four previous attempts at this problem asked the model (or a pixel
heuristic) to MEASURE something — edge density, MSER text density, what fraction
of the duration had content on screen, what fraction of the width it spanned —
and let thresholds turn that number into a routing decision. All four failed the
same way: they could not separate a spreadsheet from a corner scoreboard.

This asks for the decision itself. Measured over the 48-clip corpus against
hand-checked labels (`labels-layout.json` in the reframe-testing skill), three
runs:

    run 1   45/48  94%   18/20 content found   1 false positive of 28
    run 2   44/48  92%   17/20                 1 of 28
    run 3   46/48  96%   18/20                 0 of 28

Two clips out of 48 changed answer between runs. That matters because the
earlier note in this repo said Gemini was too non-deterministic to build on —
the same video scored 1% and 97% coverage on consecutive runs. The variance was
in asking for a continuous measurement, not in the model: a categorical choice
between closed options is stable.

It samples FRAMES instead of uploading the video. Gemini bills video at ~300
tokens per second, so an hour of source is ~1.08M tokens — past a 1M context
window before it starts — and means pushing a 1-2GB upload to get back one word.
This pipeline ingests hour-long podcasts, so that scales badly in exactly the
normal case. Twelve stills cost ~3k tokens whatever the source runs to.

Measured on the same 48 clips (whole video vs sampled frames):

    whole video          94% / 92% / 96%    18,17,18 of 20 found
    12 frames @ 640px    90% / 90%          15,16 of 20
    12 frames @ 1024px   92%                17 of 20
    24 frames @ 1024px   90%                16 of 20

Resolution was the gap, not frame count: at 640px a spreadsheet is unreadable,
and doubling the frames made it slightly worse rather than better. At 1024px the
difference from sending the whole video sits inside the run-to-run variance the
whole-video mode already has, at 2.2s per clip instead of ~15s.

Off by default (``AUTO_LAYOUT=1``). A caller that already switched layouts on
by hand wins: this only ever ADDS, so an explicit choice is never overridden.
